	<h2>This Land Is Your Land</h2>
	<p>by Woody Guthrle <br><br> This land is your land This land is my land<br>From California to the New York island;<br>
	From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters<br> This land was made for you and Me.<br><br> As I was walking that ribbon of highway, <br> I saw above me that endless skyway:
<br> I saw below me that gloden valley: <br> This land was made for you and me.<br> <br>I've roaned and rambled and I followed my footsteps<br>To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts;<br>And all around me a voice was sounding: <br> This land was made for you and me.<br> <br> 
As I went walking I saw a sign there<br> And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."<br>
But on the other side it didn't say nothing, <br>That side was made for you and me.<br><br>
In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people, <br> By the relief office I seen my peoplo;<br>As they stood there hungry, I stood
there asking<br> Is this land made for you and me?<br><br>
Nobody living can ever stop me, <br> As I go walking that freedom highway;<br> Nobody living can ever make me turn back
<br> This land was made for you and me.<br> <hr><br> <br><br> <hr><footer style="text-align: center;">
